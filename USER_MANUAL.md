## üéØ Capture Mode: From Idea to Concept

Capture Mode helps you transform a vague idea into a clear, structured concept through AI-assisted refinement.

### Step 1: Initial Idea Capture

#### Getting Started
1. **Click "Capture New Idea"** from the dashboard or navigation
2. **Fill out the idea form**:
   - **Title**: Give your idea a catchy, memorable name
   - **Description**: Describe your idea in your own words (don't worry about being perfect)
   - **Tags**: Add relevant keywords to help organize your ideas

#### Tips for the Initial Description
- **Be specific about the problem** you're trying to solve
- **Mention who would benefit** from your idea
- **Include any inspiration** or examples you've seen
- **Don't worry about technical details** yet

#### Example
```
Title: "Smart Plant Care Assistant"
Description: "I want to create something that helps people take better care of their houseplants. Maybe an app that reminds you when to water them and gives advice when they look sick. I kill plants all the time and I know others do too."
Tags: ["plants", "mobile", "reminders", "gardening"]
```

### Step 2: AI-Guided Refinement

After submitting your initial idea, you'll enter a conversation with an AI assistant designed to help you refine your concept.

#### What to Expect
- **Thoughtful Questions**: The AI will ask clarifying questions about your idea
- **Suggestions**: Get ideas for features, target audiences, and approaches
- **Structured Thinking**: Work through different aspects of your concept systematically

#### Sample AI Conversation
```
AI: "I love the plant care assistant idea! Let's explore this further. 
What specific problems do you face when caring for plants? Is it 
remembering to water them, knowing how much water to give, or 
identifying when something's wrong?"

You: "Mainly remembering to water, but also I never know if I'm 
overwatering or underwatering. And when leaves turn yellow, I 
have no idea what that means."

AI: "That's really helpful! So we're looking at three main areas: 
watering schedules, watering amounts, and plant health diagnosis. 
Who do you think would be most interested in this - complete 
beginners like yourself, or would experienced plant parents also 
find value?"
```

#### How to Engage with the AI
- **Be honest** about your experience level and goals
- **Ask questions** if you need clarification
- **Build on suggestions** that resonate with you
- **Don't worry about being "wrong"** - this is exploration time

#### Suggested Questions Feature
The AI will often provide clickable suggested questions to help move the conversation forward:
- "Who is your target audience for this idea?"
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "How would users interact with this?"
- "What makes this unique or valuable?"

### Step 3: Completing Refinement

#### When You're Ready
The refinement conversation can continue as long as you find it helpful. When you feel your idea is well-developed, click "Finish Refinement" to:
- Save your refined concept
- Update your idea status to "refined"
- Make it available for build planning

#### What You'll Have
After refinement, your idea will include:
- **Original Description**: Your initial thoughts
- **Refined Description**: An improved, clearer version
- **Problem Statement**: The core problem you're solving
- **Target Audience**: Who will benefit from your idea
- **Implementation Notes**: Key insights and considerations

## üèóÔ∏è Build Mode: From Concept to Plan

Build Mode takes your refined ideas and helps you create detailed implementation plans.

### Starting Build Mode

#### Prerequisites
- You need a refined idea (completed Capture Mode)
- Ideas with status "refined" or "building" can enter Build Mode

#### How to Start
1. **Go to your Ideas Library**
2. **Select a refined idea**
3. **Click "Start Building"** or similar option
4. **Choose to create a new build plan** or continue an existing one

### AI-Powered Plan Generation

#### Automatic Plan Creation
When you start Build Mode, the AI will automatically generate a comprehensive build plan based on your refined idea, including:

- **Project Overview**: Summary and objectives
- **Key Components**: Main features or elements needed
- **Development Phases**: Logical stages of implementation
- **Specific Tasks**: Actionable items for each phase
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion
- **Technical Considerations**: Important factors to consider

#### Example Build Plan Structure
```
Project: Smart Plant Care Assistant

Overview:
A mobile application that helps plant enthusiasts maintain healthy 
houseplants through intelligent reminders, care guidance, and health 
diagnostics.

Components:
1. Plant Database - Information about different plant species
2. Care Calendar - Personalized watering and care schedules
3. Health Scanner - Photo-based plant health assessment
4. Community Features - User tips and plant sharing

Phases:
Phase 1: Research & Planning (2-3 weeks)
- Market research and competitor analysis
- User interviews with plant enthusiasts
- Technical architecture planning
- Design system creation

Phase 2: Core Development (6-8 weeks)
- Plant database development
- Care calendar functionality
- Basic reminder system
- User profile and plant management

Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
- Health diagnostic system
- Photo analysis integration
- Community features
- Advanced notifications
```

### Collaborative Planning

#### Chat Interface
Build Mode includes a chat interface where you can:
- **Ask questions** about implementation details
- **Request modifications** to the plan
- **Explore alternatives** for different approaches
- **Get technical guidance** without actual code

#### Example Planning Conversation
```
You: "The health scanner sounds complex. How would that actually work?"

AI: "Great question! There are a few approaches for the health scanner:

1. Simple Checklist: Users answer questions about symptoms (yellow 
   leaves, brown spots, etc.) and get guidance based on common issues.

2. Photo Analysis: Users take photos and the app compares them to a 
   database of plant health conditions.

3. Expert Community: Users post photos and get advice from experienced 
   plant parents.

Which approach feels most feasible for your first version?"

You: "I like the checklist idea for starting. Much simpler."

AI: "Perfect! That's a smart approach. The checklist could include 
questions like:
- What color are the leaves? (Green, Yellow, Brown, Black)
- How do the leaves feel? (Firm, Soft, Brittle, Slimy)
- How long since you last watered?

This gives users immediate value while being technically straightforward 
to implement."
```

### Plan Management

#### Editing Plans
You can modify your build plan by:
- **Adding new components** or features
- **Updating phase timelines** and tasks
- **Changing success criteria**
- **Adding notes** and observations

#### Version Control

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### AI Not Responding
**Symptoms**: AI conversations don't generate responses or take very long

**Solutions**:
1. **Check internet connection** - AI requires active internet
2. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a simple refresh helps
3. **Try a shorter message** - Very long messages might cause issues
4. **Wait a moment** - AI responses can take 10-30 seconds

#### Ideas Not Saving
**Symptoms**: Your work disappears when you refresh or navigate away

**Solutions**:
1. **Check connection** - Ideas need internet to save to the cloud

3. **Clear browser cache** - Old cached files might cause layout issues
4. **Use a modern browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge work best

#### Export Problems
**Symptoms**: Export downloads don't work or files are corrupted

**Solutions**:
1. **Complete the build plan** - Incomplete plans might not export properly
2. **Try a different format** - Switch between Markdown and JSON
3. **Check browser downloads** - Files might be saved automatically
4. **Allow pop-ups** - Your browser might be blocking the download

### Getting Help
